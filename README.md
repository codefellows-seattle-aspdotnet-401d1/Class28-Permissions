## Identity Con't w/ Permissions

- Took me about 6 hours total.
- I struggled with creating and admin role for users who register on a different page. I wasn't sure what differentiated it from the other register page, but the demo cleared it up. I created the claim and role in the AccountController.
- I learned how to assign roles to specific users and make it so that only admins cant access certain things.
- I utilized the class demo and the docs.
